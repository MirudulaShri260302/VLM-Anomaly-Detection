# VLM-Anomaly-Detection
Analyzed Vision-Language Models like WinCLIP, WinCLIP+, and APRIL for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation using CLIP. Compared prompt engineering, multi-scale feature extraction, and reference-based matching on MVTec-AD and VisA to build scalable, label-efficient inspection systems.
