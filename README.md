# VLM-Anomaly-Detection
Analyzed Vision-Language Models like WinCLIP, WinCLIP+ for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation using CLIP. Compared prompt engineering, multi-scale feature extraction, and reference-based matching on MVTec-AD, VisA, and SDD to build scalable, label-efficient inspection systems.
